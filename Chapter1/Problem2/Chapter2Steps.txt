Chapter 1 problem 2

I: The problem was to determine if the strings we are permutation 

D:My goal is to transverse the String and check if they have the same character account 

E:my idea was to use a stack to add everything from the first string, and then popped when transversing the second string and if
it was empty return true, otherwise return false

A:I anticipated to work however when I coded it I found out that the order of the words did matter because it would take longer 
if I the two similar words were at the end of the string and I would stil lhave to transverse the array 
with anything else in the array, and if it did I would return false

L: I learned that it would make more sense to make an array with all ascii characters and add a value to that, and if the ascii 
array was not empty, it would mean that it was not a permutation
