Chapter 1 problem 1

I: The problem was to determine if the string we are given is completely unique 
D:My goal is to transverse the String and check if there's any duplicates
E:I could of done a hash set where if it tries to add the same value it will just return false. However it asked 
what if there was no other databases so I decided in a char Array.
A:So i simply just made the string into an array, and transversed it via 2 for loops to check if the first value matched
with anything else in the array, and if it did I would return false
