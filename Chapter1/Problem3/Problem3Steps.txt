Chapter 1 problem 3

I: The problem was to replace spaces with 20%

D:My goal is to transverse the String and replace the spaces with 20%
 
E:my idea was to simply make a string builder, take the original string and call stringBuilder.replace to replace
the character at position i where the space was with 20%

A:I anticipated to work however when I ran the program I soon realized it could only replace one char so it was not 
that simple, so then I decided to increase the index by 3 whenever i replaced the space in order to keep transversing
correctly. But all it did was replace the space with % and the next two spaces in the char array as well


L: I learned via the solution that it would of made more sense to work from the back to the front instead of the 
front to the back. Because we could always add spaces to the end which meant you could easily put add the spaces
required to make room for the %20
