I: The problem was to check if the words was a palidrone 

D:My goal is to transverse the String, and make sure its a palidrone.
 
E:my idea was to simply make an int ascii array, and increase the count everytime we saw a character, and only decrease it if we
saw the character twice. So the ascii array will always be 1, unless it repeated.

A:I anticipated the code to work well however when I ran the code, because I used the same string to transverse it, it would
constantly delete the count in the ascii array. Regardless if it was seen twice or not 


L: I learned via the solution that it would of been smart to simply make an array and add to the same place and if the count
was odd it meant it was not a palidrone because we had to just check if all the characters inserted were even
