Chapter 1 problem 3

I: The problem was to make a stack with a min function, as well with a push and pop

D:My goal is to transverse the stack and return the minimum value without popping or pushing anything else 

E:my idea was to simply make a min variable update everytime you added a value to the stack gets added 

A:I had to find a new way because the min of a stack for the whole thing could be different than the min of a stack, for example the minimum value for the first stack could be bigger than the min value of the second stack which would give an error. So what I did was to simply make a temporary stack with all the values of the current stack we are getting and keep popping until its empty and simply return the smallest variable.

L: I learned that using a variable to contain a single answer was efficient but not always working due to how I had the code set up so I found a solution that was slower but got the job done.
